#Animal Farm is, after Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's most famous#
#book. Published in 1945, the novella (at under 100 pages, it's too#
#short to be called a full-blown ‘novel') tells the story of how a#
#group of animals on a farm overthrow the farmer who puts them to work,#
#and set up an equal society where all animals work and share the fruits#
#of their labours!#
##
#However, as time goes on, it becomes clear that the society the animals#
#have constructed is not equal at all. It's well-known that the novella#
#is an allegory for Communist Russia under Josef Stalin, who was leader#
#of the Soviet Union when Orwell wrote the book.#
##
#Curiously, the book very nearly didn't make it into print at all. First,#
#not long after Orwell completed the first draft in February 1944, his#
#flat on Mortimer Crescent in London was bombed in June, and he feared the#
#typescript had been destroyed. Orwell later found it in the rubble. Then,#
#Orwell had difficulty finding a publisher. T. S. Eliot, at Faber and#
#Faber, rejected it (you can read Eliot's letter to Orwell here).#
##
#The novella was eventually published the following year, in 1945, and#
#its relevance – as political satire, as animal fable, and as one of#
#Orwell's two great works of fiction – shows no signs of abating.#
